          In this query, we want to look into the impact that criminal activity may have on residential property sales prices. Criminal offenses can range from first to third degrees in each county, depending on the severity of the crime. The query investigates whether severe or less severe average degrees of criminal offenses may lower or increase the value of a residential property in different counties over time. To determine a trend, we look at the most common degree of a criminal offense and the corresponding average sale price of a property in a county over time and compare it to other counties.
