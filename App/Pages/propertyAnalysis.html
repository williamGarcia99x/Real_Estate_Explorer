        The state of the housing market has a significant impact on consumer
        decisions when it comes to purchasing a home. Analyzing housing market
        trends can provide valuable insights into the overall landscape,
        particularly in a state as diverse and dynamic as Florida. The analysis
        of housing market trends involves studying various indicators. This can
        include examining home prices, the rate of home sales, among other
        factors.

          This query represents a portion of the housing market's state. A
          period in which residential properties are sold for less than their
          market value denotes a weak market, whereas prices several orders of
          magnitude higher than their market value denotes a strong housing
          market. This analysis gives an idea of what is going on in order to
          make a decision to buy a home during that time period. For a given
          county, this query involves the quotient of the sale price by the
          market value subtracted by one. In this manner, the user can see
          monthly trends with each percentage (e.g., the sale price is 33%
          higher than the market value for month x.)

          This query can provide valuable insights for several compelling
          reasons. For example, if a buyer prefers to buy an older property over
          a new one, they can use this information to gain negotiating power if
          older homes tend to appreciate at a slower rate. It can even help
          owners of older properties with highlighting their property’s value
          relative to its age. Both parties in such negotiations may benefit
          from the information revealed by this query.

          The results of this query provide significant guidance to
          stakeholders. For example, if greater land sizes are regularly
          associated with higher sales frequency, this information can be used
          to inform investment strategies and indicate areas of increased market
          activity. Understanding whether smaller land sizes are in more demand
          during various periods, on the other hand, allows buyers and sellers
          to adjust their strategies accordingly.
